This is a placeholder file. In a real implementation, you would need to add actual image files here:

1. indo-pak-tensions.jpg - For the main article about Indo-Pak tensions
2. placeholder-1.jpg, placeholder-2.jpg, placeholder-3.jpg - For the news cards
3. region-asia.jpg, region-europe.jpg, etc. - For the regions page
4. newsroom.jpg - For the about page
5. editor-1.jpg, editor-2.jpg, etc. - For the team section
6. favicon.ico - For the website favicon
7. logo-social.jpg - For social media sharing

These images would need to be properly sized and optimized for web use.
